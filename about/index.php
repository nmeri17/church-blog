		<h1> About this blog </h1>
		<p>
		I stand in the sun haplessly, while the man corporately foisted on me sat in his wagon, braying orders at me thoughtlessly. The most I could do was listen on;
		albeit with contempt. The sun behind me represented a powerful
		current propelling the billows of sweat that took their origins from the top of my head right into the lobes of my buttocks. But this man did not care.
So on that rainy evening, I was driving home--weary from the day's exertions--soft-pedalling the accelerator. But that was till I beheld the utterly delightful sight
of my boss, crotched beside his car, frantically trying to revive it. Somehow, I observed that he was positioned adjacent to a pothole filled with just enough water to bath a man his size. I knew there was no chance in seven hells of
him recognizing my car--not that night. So as I forcefully drove in and out of that dent, I basked in the shrill cry I spontaneously heard from his direction.
I asked myself if that did not sound better than the braying sound he made under fairer circumstances. As I sped off that merry night, I told myself I was going to celebrate this small victory on my arrival at home. But this was not to be.

# church-blog
Church blog with cms built with the first version Suphle Framework

Admin panel currently allows for management and creation of sermons, discussions and in-browser edition of podcasts

Refactoring it to use the current version of Suphle is not in my agenda as, in comparison to its state here, framework was rewritten from the ground up.

I'm not convinced that a blog has sufficiently complicated logic that can be used as backdrop to demonstrate Suphle in a real life application.

To that effect, all motivation to work on this some other time is currently withdrawn
